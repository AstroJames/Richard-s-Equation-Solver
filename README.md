# A solver for a non-linear PDE, Richard's Equation

This is a non-linear PDE solver for Richard's equation, written in MATLAB. Richard's equation describes flow through a porous medium. In this project we modelled how coal seam gas extraction would the effect the groundwater system in Dalby, Australia.

I will provide more documentation once I get a bit more organised.
